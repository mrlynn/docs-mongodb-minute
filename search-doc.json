Hook (0-5 seconds)​  Purpose: Grab attention immediately  Best Practices:  Start with a question or surprising factUse numbers or statistics when possibleCreate curiosity or urgencyAvoid generic openings  Example:  &quot;Did you know that most MongoDB performance issues come from just one missing index?&quot;  2. Problem/Context (5-15 seconds)​  Purpose: Establish the problem or context  Best Practices:  Be specific, not genericRelate to common developer pain pointsSet up the solution clearlyKeep it concise  Example:  &quot;When your queries are slow, it's often because MongoDB is scanning entire collections instead of using an index.&quot;  3. Tip/Solution (15-45 seconds)​  Purpose: Deliver the core educational content  Best Practices:  One clear, actionable tipShow the solution, don't just describe itUse simple languageInclude a brief code example if relevant  Example:  &quot;Create a compound index on the fields you query most. For example, if you filter by category and sort by date, create an index on both: db.products.createIndex({ category: 1, date: -1 })&quot;  4. Quick Win/Proof (45-52 seconds)​  Purpose: Demonstrate the benefit or result  Best Practices:  Show the impact (faster queries, cleaner code, etc.)Use concrete examplesMake it tangible  Example:  &quot;This single index can reduce query time from 500ms to under 10ms.&quot;  5.
